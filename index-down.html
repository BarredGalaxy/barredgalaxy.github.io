  <h1>Graffiti</h1>
  <p>Barred, or <b>[name removed for privacy]</b>, graffitied <b>[name removed for privacy]</b> School with the tag Barred. I take full responsibility for this and i want you to know that at <b>[name removed for privacy]</b>, i and others were faced with constant graffiti and i thought it was cool so i tried it. i did it and then had a mini panic attack and tried to remove it. I realilise how bad it was.</p>
  <p>Later i picked up the name 'barred' for coding so i made a website. i wrote the name of the website, 'Barred.ga' on he side of an outdoor cement stairwell thinking it would wash off in the rain. The art teacher got concerned and they traced the name back to me. They took me outside to look at what i had done. in the process they saw the vent i had defaced at the beginning of the year when barred was my tag, not my full blown name. I am very regretful of doing that because thats not me. thats old me. thats not me. thanks for understanding.</p>
